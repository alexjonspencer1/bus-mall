# Technical Plan

## Bus-Mall Technical Plan

Make the following for scaffolding:

* Start with the following: bus-mall.html, user-stores.md, bus-mall.css. 

* Then create test documents: index.html, index.js. 

* Then pull in outside configs: .eslintrc, .gitignore, .travis.yml, etc. 

I will need to develop the aesthetic using HTML and CSS, creating a framework for the site and the image buttons. Once I have the aesthetic created and formed, I can start to work on the flowchart for writing Javascript, and once that's completed, begin work on the Javascript as a whole. 



## Bus-Mall User Stories

#### User Story | Marketing Research Team

As a lean, early stage startup with limited capital, we have to ensure that the content we're distributing lines up with the public demand. If we fail to conduct proper market research, we may waste limited resources and funding on a catalog of goods that will not sell, and will lose our user's interest. Success of this company is dependent on targeted content that will a) provide an escape from the drudgery of bus travel and b) cause recurring interest in our catalog, in turn generating repeat customers. 

As a team, we want to track the items users have viewed, and further track the items that they have selected amongst the three images. In this case, the more data insight we have, the better we can prepare targeted content. 

#### User Story | Focus Group Participant

As a focus group participant, I want a clean and clear UI experience that properly guides me through the exercise so I can complete my task and earn my focus group gift card. As a participant, I also want clear instructions, and when completed with the task, a summary of my results.
